# English to French Recurrent Neural Network
TensorFlow implementation of a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained from scratch to translate English to French.
![Example translation output from the RNN][image_output]

## Project Information
The included [`./dlnd_language_translation.ipynb`](https://github.com/JackBurdick/English_to_French_RNN/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb) provides a commented walk though of the network generation and evaluation.

## Future Improvements:
1. More data: [link](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/training-giga-fren.tar){this link is an auto-download!}
2. Hyperparameter tuning

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained from scratch to translate English to French.
The [notebook](https://github.com/JackBurdick/English_to_French_RNN/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb) shows the tensorflow implementation from data input to predicted output.

Translation could be improved with;
    1. More data: [link](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/training-giga-fren.tar){this link is an auto-download!}
    2. Hyperparameter tuning
